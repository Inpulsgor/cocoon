      "Very good delivery, very well wrapped. An A* sofa, especially for the cost. A very sturdy well made bit of kit compared to others that I have seen (most had legs no better than a decorators table) this is a different class, had about 5 nights on it so far and very comfortable, highly recommended!",

      "Great! Very comfortable. Just what we've been looking for. Have opened up the bed but not yet slept on it. The 2 gentlemen who delivered the sofa bed were very good, even with the difficulty in getting it through the door.",
